The potential $V_ i$ of cell $\mathcal{C}_ i$ centred at position $\mathbf{r}_ i$ is related to the surface charge densities $\sigma_ j$ of cells $\mathcal{C}_ j$ $j\in[1,N]$ through the superposition principle as: $$V_ i = \sum_ {j=0}^{N} \frac{\sigma_ j}{4\pi\varepsilon_ 0} \int_ {\mathcal{C}_ j} \frac{1}{|\mathbf{r}_ i-\mathbf{r}'|} \mathrm{d}^2\mathbf{r}' = \sum_{j=0}^{N} Q_ {ij} \sigma_ j,$$ where the integral over the surface of cell $\mathcal{C}_ j$ only depends on $\mathcal{C}_ j$ shape and on the relative position of the target point $\mathbf{r}_ i$ with respect to $\mathcal{C}_ j$ location, as $\sigma_ j$ is assumed constant over the whole surface of cell $\mathcal{C}_ j$.
